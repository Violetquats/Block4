# Block4
Name: Violet
Period: 4
Virtual / Hybrid / In-Person Class: Yes.
Programming Experience: I'm a sophomore and I've been working with python since the start of freshman year. I've used other things, but do those games where you drag those blocks of code really count?

9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

We used html, A-frame, and mained in python. It was probably about 20 weeks worth of coding, in which I made several programs using a variety of commands. 

10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).

So far in my sophomore year I have had about six weeks of work where I actually coded games and stuff, and I spent about eight weeks working with coding in a virtual reality setting where i didn't code, but did discuss the code and aspects behind immersive virtual reality games.

What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

I would like to expand my entire coding .library so that I have more commands that I am able to use and maybe know more ways to use the ones that I already have experience with.

What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

I think that I often manage to forget how to use my commands and set up variables. 

What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

I want to be able to write basic stuff well. I'd love to be able to write more advanced stuff, too, but I know that I'd just forget it shortly after.
